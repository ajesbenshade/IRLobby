## Objective

Develop a single-page web application using a **Full-Stack JavaScript** technology stack that combines Tinder’s swipe-based matching with Halo’s multiplayer lobby system for social activities. Users can host or join events (e.g., boating, basketball, drinks) by swiping to match based on mutual interest and attendee preferences. The app should be intuitive, secure, scalable, and monetizable, running seamlessly in modern browsers with a focus on user engagement and privacy.

## 1. User Accounts and Profiles

- **Sign-Up**:
  - Register via email, phone, or social media (e.g., Google, Facebook) using **Firebase Authentication** with OAuth 2.0.
  - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) via SMS or authenticator apps.
  - Require user consent for data usage with opt-in/opt-out for analytics or AI training.
- **Profiles**:
  - Store name, age, location, bio, interests, and optional photos in a **MongoDB** collection via **Mongoose**.
  - Support friend connections via manual addition or social media import (e.g., Firebase social auth).
  - Ensure accessibility with ARIA attributes and high-contrast CSS themes.
- **Privacy**:
  - Anonymize location data (e.g., store only city-level coordinates using **Geolib**).
  - Allow users to control profile visibility and data sharing via a settings panel.

## 2. Hosting an Activity

- **Creation**:
  - Hosts specify via a **React** form component:
    - Activity name/description (e.g., “Trivia Night at Joe’s Pub”).
    - Participant limit (1–20 people).
    - Date, time, and location (using **Google Maps JavaScript API** for geolocation).
    - Privacy: Public (all users) or Private (friends/invite-only).
  - Allow image/video uploads, stored in **Azure Blob Storage** via **@azure/storage-blob**.
  - Set flexible attendee preferences (e.g., age range, interests) as metadata in MongoDB.
- **Tag-Based Matchmaking**:
  - Assign tags to activities (e.g., “sports”, “outdoor”) and user profiles (e.g., “active”, “social”).
  - Calculate match percentages using a cosine similarity algorithm implemented in JavaScript.
- **UX**:
  - Provide activity templates using **React Select** for common events (e.g., sports, dining).
  - Validate inputs client-side with **Formik** and server-side with **Joi**.

## 3. Browsing and Swiping

- **Discovery**:
  - Display activities in a **React-Swipeable-Views** component with filters for location, date, type, or privacy.
  - Recommend activities using a JavaScript algorithm based on user interests, location, and past participation, cached in **Redis**.
- **Swiping**:
  - **Participants**: Swipe right to join, left to pass.
  - **Hosts**: Swipe right to approve, left to reject interested users.
  - Show activity details, host profile, and participant count in a **React Card** component.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use CSS animations (via **Framer Motion**) for swipe feedback (e.g., green for right, red for left).
  - Implement an “undo” swipe with a 5-second buffer using **React Context**.
  - Confirm rejections with a **React-Modal** prompt.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Cache swipes locally using **localStorage** during network failures, syncing via **Axios** when online.
  - Handle schedule conflicts by checking user activity times in MongoDB.

## 4. Matching and Group Formation

- **Matching**:
  - A match occurs when a participant swipes right and the host approves.
  - Use **Socket.IO** for real-time match notifications.
  - Store matches in a **Match** MongoDB collection.
- **Group Management**:
  - Close activities at the participant limit or by host action.
  - Reopen spots if participants leave, with **Socket.IO** updates.
- **Group Chat**:
  - Create chats for confirmed participants using **Socket.IO** for text, emojis, and image sharing.
  - Implement host moderation (mute, remove users) and a reporting system.
  - Use **Node.js crypto** for end-to-end encryption of chat messages.
- **Safety**:
  - Limit personal data in chats (e.g., no auto-sharing of contact info).
  - Store reports in MongoDB for admin review.

## 5. Activity Management

- **Host Controls**:
  - Edit/cancel activities via a **React Router** settings page, notifying participants with **Socket.IO**.
  - Send reminders 24 hours before events using **Node-Cron**.
- **Participant Options**:
  - Allow leaving activities, triggering notifications and spot reopening.
- **Post-Event**:
  - Collect 1–5 star ratings and feedback via a **React-Bootstrap Modal**.
  - Calculate reputation scores based on ratings, stored in the **User** collection.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Handle cancellations by offering rescheduling options via email (using **Nodemailer**).
  - Prevent double-booking with server-side validation.

## 6. Social Features

- **Connections**:
  - Invite friends to private activities via app links or external sharing (e.g., **React-Share**).
  - Follow users to view public activities, stored in a **Follow** collection.
- **History**:
  - Display past activities in a **React-Virtualized List** with a “rehost” button.
- **Engagement**:
  - Send notifications for matches, updates, and chats using **Firebase Cloud Messaging**.
  - Nudge users to complete profiles or RSVP with **React-Toastify**.

## 7. User Interface

- **Design**:
  - Build a Tinder-like swipe interface with **React-Swipeable-Views** and **Framer Motion** animations.
  - Home screen: **React-Slick** carousel for recommended activities and upcoming events.
  - Profile screen: **React-Bootstrap Tabs** for user info, history, and settings.
  - Use **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, modern styling.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards with ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
  - Support dynamic font scaling via CSS media queries.
- **Feedback**:
  - Include a **React-Form** for reporting UI issues or suggestions.

- Express API documentation (via **Swagger**).
- User guide (Markdown) detailing features and navigation.
- Unit tests with **Jest** for core logic (e.g., matching algorithm).

## Success Criteria

- 60%+ users attend an event within the first month.
- Real-time features maintain <1-second latency.

- 90%+ crash-free sessions in beta testing.
- Positive feedback (>4/5 stars) on usability.

## Key Considerations

- **UX**: Swipe interfaces need clear feedback and confirmations (NN/g).
- **Matchmaking**: Tag-based systems improve relevance (Eventify).
- **Security**: JWT and encryption ensure trust (Sprout Social).
- **Monetization**: Freemium and sponsorships balance revenue (Mighty Networks).
- **Full-Stack JS**: React and Node.js enable rapid development and scalability (Yalantis).
