## Objective

Develop a cross-platform mobile application using **C#** and **.NET MAUI** that combines Tinder’s swipe-based matching with Halo’s multiplayer lobby system for social activities. Users can host or join events (e.g., boating, basketball, drinks) by swiping to match based on mutual interest and attendee preferences. The app should be intuitive, secure, scalable, and monetizable, leveraging .NET MAUI’s capabilities for a seamless iOS and Android experience.

## 1. User Accounts and Profiles

- **Sign-Up**:
  - Register via email, phone, or social media (e.g., Google, Microsoft) using **Microsoft.Identity.Client** for OAuth 2.0 authentication.
  - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) via SMS or authenticator apps.
  - Ensure user consent for data usage with clear opt-in/opt-out for AI training or analytics.
- **Profiles**:
  - Store name, age, location, bio, interests, and optional photos in a **SQLite** database via **Entity Framework Core**.
  - Support friend connections via manual addition or social media import (e.g., Microsoft Graph API).
  - Ensure accessibility with **.NET MAUI Accessibility** helpers (e.g., semantic properties for screen readers) and high-contrast themes.
- **Privacy**:
  - Anonymize location data (e.g., store only approximate coordinates).
  - Allow users to control profile visibility and data sharing preferences.

## 2. Hosting an Activity

- **Creation**:
  - Hosts specify via a **.NET MAUI Shell** form:
    - Activity name/description (e.g., “Pickup Basketball at Central Park”).
    - Participant limit (1–20 people).
    - Date, time, and location (using **.NET MAUI Geolocation**).
    - Privacy: Public (all users) or Private (friends/invite-only).
  - Allow image/video uploads (stored in **Azure Blob Storage**).
  - Set flexible attendee preferences (e.g., age range, interests) as suggestions, stored as metadata.
- **Tag-Based Matchmaking**:
  - Assign tags to activities (e.g., “sports”, “outdoor”) and user profiles (e.g., “active”, “social”).
  - Calculate match percentages using a cosine similarity algorithm on tags, implemented in C#.
- **UX**:
  - Use **.NET MAUI CollectionView** for activity creation templates (e.g., pre-filled fields for common events).
  - Provide real-time validation for inputs (e.g., valid dates).

## 3. Browsing and Swiping

- **Discovery**:
  - Display activities in a **.NET MAUI SwipeView** with filters for location, date, type, or privacy.
  - Recommend activities using a C# algorithm based on user interests, location, and past participation.
- **Swiping**:
  - **Participants**: Swipe right to join, left to pass.
  - **Hosts**: Swipe right to approve, left to reject interested users.
  - Show activity details, host profile, and participant count in a **.NET MAUI ContentPage**.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use clear visual cues (e.g., green for right, red for left) via **.NET MAUI VisualStateManager**.
  - Implement an “undo” swipe with a 5-second buffer.
  - Confirm rejections to prevent accidental dismissals.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handle network failures by caching swipes locally using **SQLite** and syncing when online.
  - Notify users of swipe conflicts (e.g., overlapping activity times).

## 4. Matching and Group Formation

- **Matching**:
  - A match occurs when a participant swipes right and the host approves.
  - Use **SignalR** for real-time match notifications.
  - Store matches in a **Match** table via **Entity Framework Core**.
- **Group Management**:
  - Close activities at the participant limit or by host action.
  - Reopen spots if participants leave, with **SignalR** updates to users.
- **Group Chat**:
  - Create chats for confirmed participants using **Azure Communication Services** for text, emojis, and image sharing.
  - Implement host moderation (mute, remove users) and a reporting system.
  - Use end-to-end encryption for chat messages.
- **Safety**:
  - Limit personal data sharing in chats (e.g., no auto-sharing of phone numbers).
  - Allow users to report/block others, with reports stored for review.

## 5. Activity Management

- **Host Controls**:
  - Edit/cancel activities via a **.NET MAUI FlyoutPage**, notifying participants via **Azure Notification Hubs**.
  - Send reminders 24 hours before events.
- **Participant Options**:
  - Allow leaving activities, triggering notifications and spot reopening.
- **Post-Event**:
  - Collect 1–5 star ratings and feedback via a **.NET MAUI Popup**.
  - Calculate reputation scores based on ratings, stored in the **User** table.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Handle last-minute cancellations by notifying participants and offering rescheduling options.
  - Prevent double-booking by checking user schedules during swipes.

## 6. Social Features

- **Connections**:
  - Invite friends to private activities via app links or external sharing (e.g., SMS, email).
  - Follow users to view public activities, stored in a **Follow** table.
- **History**:
  - Display past activities in a **.NET MAUI ListView** with a “rehost” button.
- **Engagement**:
  - Use **Azure Notification Hubs** for match, update, and chat notifications.
  - Nudge users to complete profiles or RSVP via in-app prompts.

## 7. User Interface

- **Design**:
  - Implement a Tinder-like swipe interface with **.NET MAUI SwipeView** and animations via **SkiaSharp**.
  - Home screen: **.NET MAUI CarouselView** for recommended activities and upcoming events.
  - Profile screen: **.NET MAUI TabbedPage** for user info, history, and settings.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards using **.NET MAUI SemanticProperties**.
  - Support dynamic font scaling and voice-over navigation.
- **Feedback**:
  - Include a **.NET MAUI Entry** form for reporting UI issues or suggestions.
